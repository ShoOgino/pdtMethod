	/**
	 * StringMatcher constructor takes in a String object that is a simple 
	 * pattern. The pattern may contain '*' for 0 and many characters and
	 * '?' for exactly one character.  
	 *
	 * Literal '*' and '?' characters must be escaped in the pattern 
	 * e.g., "\*" means literal "*", etc.
	 *
	 * Escaping any other character (including the escape character itself), 
	 * just results in that character in the pattern.
	 * e.g., "\a" means "a" and "\\" means "\"
	 *
	 * If invoking the StringMatcher with string literals in Java, don't forget
	 * escape characters are represented by "\\".
	 *
	 * @param pattern the pattern to match text against
	 * @param ignoreCase if true, case is ignored
	 * @param ignoreWildCards if true, wild cards and their escape sequences are ignored
	 * 		  (everything is taken literally).
