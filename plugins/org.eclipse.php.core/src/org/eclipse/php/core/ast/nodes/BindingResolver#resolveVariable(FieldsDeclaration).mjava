	 * function of the context in which the variable declaration node is
	 * embedded as well as the variable declaration subtree itself.
	 * VariableDeclaration declarations used as local variable, formal parameter
	 * and exception variables resolve to local variable bindings; variable
	 * declarations used to declare fields resolve to field bindings.
