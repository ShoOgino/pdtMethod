	/**
	 * Returns whether this type binding represents a capture binding.
	 * <p>
	 * Capture bindings result from capture conversion as specified
	 * in section 5.1.10 of <em>The Java Language Specification,
	 * Third Edition</em> (JLS3).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * A capture binding may have upper bounds and a lower bound.
	 * Upper bounds may be accessed using {@link #getTypeBounds()},
	 * the lower bound must be accessed indirectly through the associated
	 * wildcard {@link #getWildcard()} when it is a lower bound wildcard.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that capture bindings are distinct from type variables
     * (even though they are often depicted as synthetic type
     * variables); as such, {@link #isTypeVariable()} answers
     * <code>false</code> for capture bindings, and
     * {@link #isCapture()} answers <code>false</code> for type variables.
	 * </p>
     *
	 * @return <code>true</code> if this type binding is a capture,
	 *   and <code>false</code> otherwise
	 * @see #getTypeBounds()
	 * @see #getWildcard()
	 * @since 3.1
