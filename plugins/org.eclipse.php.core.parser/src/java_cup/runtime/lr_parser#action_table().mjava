  /** The action table (supplied by generated subclass).  This table is
   *  indexed by state and terminal number indicating what action is to
   *  be taken when the parser is in the given state (i.e., the given state 
   *  is on top of the stack) and the given terminal is next on the input.  
   *  States are indexed using the first dimension, however, the entries for 
   *  a given state are compacted and stored in adjacent index, value pairs 
   *  which are searched for rather than accessed directly (see get_action()).  
   *  The actions stored in the table will be either shifts, reduces, or 
   *  errors.  Shifts are encoded as positive values (one greater than the 
   *  state shifted to).  Reduces are encoded as negative values (one less 
   *  than the production reduced by).  Error entries are denoted by zero. 
   * 
   * @see java_cup.runtime.lr_parser#get_action
